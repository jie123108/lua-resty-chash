Installation
============

You need to compile [ngx_lua](https://github.com/chaoslawful/lua-nginx-module/tags) with your Nginx.

You need to configure
the [lua_package_path](https://github.com/chaoslawful/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path) directive to
add the path of your `lua-resty-geohash` source tree to ngx_lua's Lua module search path, as in

    # nginx.conf
    http {
        lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-geohash/lib/?.lua;;";
        ...
    }

and then load the library in Lua:

    local gh = require "resty.geohash"
